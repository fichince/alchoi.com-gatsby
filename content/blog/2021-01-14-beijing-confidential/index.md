It might not be accurate to call this a review. The back cover copy will tell you what to expect: a travelogue of a family vacation, some history about China in the time of the Cultural Revolution, and a reckoning with a shameful part of the author's past. As a foreign exchange student at Beijing University during the Cultural Revolution, Jan Wong ratted out a classmate who expressed a treasonous desire to leave the country for the West. The classmate disappeared and Wong, driven by guilt, is on a mission to find her and make amends.

The search for the classmate gives the book a narrative drive. It works, but I thought it was a bit overblown. It turns out that the classmate would have been in lot of trouble anyway, whether or not Wong had reported her. In essence, Wong's role in the whole affair was minimal, and her guilt about it, while valid, isn't expressed with enough emotional weight to sustain a whole book. It makes her seem self-centred by making it all about herself.

Having said that, let's now make it all about me. _Beijing Confidential_ is written with a certain tone that feels uncomfortably familiar to me: that of an Asian person, raised in the West, looking back on the "homeland" with foreign eyes, and seeing mostly absurdity and otherness. I've [written in this mode before](), and the general feeling that this type of writing evokes is, _Wow, isn't it strange over there?_

_Isn't it strange that you can get so easily sick from air pollution?_

_Isn't it strange that they eat those smelly durian fruits?_

_Isn't it strange that a Communist country has embraced capitalism so readily?_

If I had read this book five years ago, this tone would have struck a genuine chord with me, because it's basically how I feel. Reading it now, I'm turned off by it because I've been questioning the biases that have made me feel this way in the past. My family is from Hong Kong, and growing up, I absorbed an anti-Mainland sentiment. Compared to Hong Kong's modernity, we looked at Mainland Chinese citizens as backwards and uncivilized and rude. The speed of China's eventual growth was seen as unearned, like they had gotten there by cheating.

When Hong Kong was struck by [civil unrest][2] a couple of years ago, it was a natural reaction for me to take the side of the protestors, against China.  Some members of my family went the other way, to my surprise. It shocked and confused me because it seemed to be such a 180 from what I was used to growing up. I was stressed and upset.

Now that time has passed, I'm ready to see their side of it.
